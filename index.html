        Hello. My name is Bobby Ressnowski and I am learning to code. I am building this website to track my brogress and describe my journey. 
        For the most part this is a record for me, but if you get something out of it then I am all the more happy. Thanks for being here. I'm happy to be learning and sharing with you.
